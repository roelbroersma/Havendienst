## 🚤 Boat Rental/Booking

The booking platform is based on open-source code: WordPress, WooCommerce Bookings, WooCommerce Deposits, WooCommerce Vendors, and WCFM + WCFM Ultimate. We use several custom-made plugins like:
- "Per Product Google Calendar Sync"
- "Per Vendor Stripe Keys"

Bugs, feature requests, and other issues about the platform can be made through the [Issues](https://github.com/roelbroersma/Havendienst/issues) button.

## 🆘 Boat Assistance (Pechhulp)

Boat assistance is available at [Havendienst.nl/Pechhulp](https://www.havendienst.nl/pechhulp) and is used by people who are currently having trouble with their boat and are on (the middle of) the water. After a request has been made, this request will be sent in a WhatsApp group of local volunteers. A volunteer may help after they reply (so other volunteers know someone is going to give assistance). The volunteer gets 100% of the money, prices are always fixed.
