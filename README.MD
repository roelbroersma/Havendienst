This is the [Havendienst.nl](https://havendienst.nl) platform. It features three main areas:

**1. Boat rental/booking (for customers and vendors)**

**2. Boat Assistance (Pechhulp)**

**3. Watertaxi**




This project will also include general documentation, merchandise and other stuff in the merchandise folder. This may include: flags, stickers, flyers, etc..

**1. The booking platform** is based on open-source code: Wordpress, Woocommerce Bookings, Woocommerce Deposits, Woocommerce Vendors and WCFM + WCFM Ultimate.
We use several custom made plugins like: "Per Prododuct Google Calendar Sync" and "Per vendor Stripe keys".
Bugs, Feature Requests and other issues about the platform can be made through the [Issues](https://github.com/roelbroersma/Havendienst/issues) button.

**2. Boat assistance (Pechhulp)** is available at [Havendienst.nl/Pechhulp](https://havendienst.nl/Pechhulp) and is used by people who are currently having trouble with their boat and are on (the middle of) the water. After a request has been made, this request will be send in a WhatsApp group of local volunteers. A volunteer may help after he replied (so the other volunteers know there is someone going to give assistance). The volunteer gets 100% of the money, prices are always fixed.

**3. Watertaxi** should be booked 2 days or more in advance.
